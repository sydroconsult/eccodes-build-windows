# eccodes-build-windows

Automated ECMWF EcCodes library and tools builds for Windows [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/u69v3e89iy521474?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sydroconsult/eccodes-build-windows)


This repository is almost empty and consists mostly of an appveyor build file. 
The original source code resides there : [https://github.com/ecmwf/eccodes](https://github.com/ecmwf/eccodes) (Apache 2 License)

The stuff resides inside the [releases page](https://github.com/sydroconsult/eccodes-build-windows/releases) where compiled binaries are available.

The build system compiles EcCodes with the following features enabled :

  * JPEG support (via openjpeg)
  * PNG support (via libpng)
  * NetCDF support (via libnetcdf)
  * Adaptive Entropy Coding (AEC) for GRIB decoding/encoding (CCSDS) (via libaec)

Those features should make tools/lib able to read all grib packings supported by EcCodes (tested with NOAA GFS, Méteo-France AROME/ARPEGE, DWD ICON, ECMWF WMO Essentials forecasts).

## Requirements

 * [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) as MSVC 2019 C Compiler toolchain and SDKs are used.

## Installation

Grab the binaries zip (EcCodes-win-x64.zip) from the releases pages, unzip it to `C:\`, add `C:\ECMWF\bin` to your PATH and you are good to go.
If you decide to unzip it anywhere else you will have to create 2 additional environment variables :

  * `ECCODES_DEFINITION_PATH`, pointing to `<UNZIPPED_PATH>\ECMWF\share\eccodes\definitions`
  * `ECCODES_SAMPLES_PATH`, pointing to `<UNZIPPED_PATH>\ECMWF\share\eccodes\samples`

So that the library and command line tools can find needed assets to operate.

Python 3 + eccodes-python package _should_ work without any problem if `eccodes.dll` can be found in your `PATH`.

## Possible evolutions

  * 32bit build
  * Chocolatey Package
